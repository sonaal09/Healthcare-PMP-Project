# Healthcare-PMP-Project
Comparative study of software development lifecycle models for a Hospital Patient Management System (HPMS), evaluating Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, DevOps, and V-Model for reliability, security, and compliance in healthcare IT projects.
## ðŸ“‚ Overview
This project was part of the MSc Information Systems module on Project Management (IS40890) at University College Dublin. It evaluates the development of a critical healthcare system through the lens of compliance, patient safety, reliability, scalability, and change resilience.

## ðŸ§¾ Key Contents
- Critical factors in HPMS development: security, scalability, usability, and regulation
- Pros and cons of major SDLC methodologies
- Comparative assessment of Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, Spiral, V-Model, and DevOps
- Justification for selecting the **V-Model** as the most suitable for HPMS

## âœ… Conclusion
The project concludes that the **V-Model** best suits the demands of healthcare systems due to its structured verification process, strong documentation, and alignment with legal and regulatory standards like GDPR/HIPAA.
